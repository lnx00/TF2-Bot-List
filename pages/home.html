<h2>Welcome!</h2>
<p>
    This site was created to make the process of installing Bot Lists in Team Fortress 2 / TF2 Bot Detector easier.<br/>
    You can simply download various file formats that will be converted automatically.<br/>
    It is recommended to use <a href="https://github.com/PazerOP/tf2_bot_detector" target="_blank">Pazer's TF2 Bot Detector</a>, that will kick bots from your game.<br/>
    <br/>
    If you have problems installing / importing one of the lists then you can read the guides on the <a href="javascript:void()" onclick="LoadPage('download')">Download page</a>.<br/>
    They will also help you installing the TF2 Bot Detector.<br/>
    <br/>
    Advanced users can also use Tools to convert your own Bot List into other formats (List, JSON, TF2 Bot Detector) or find bots that aren't added to <a href="https://gist.github.com/wgetJane/0bc01bd46d7695362253c5a2fa49f2e9" target="_blank">wgetJane's Bot List</a> yet.<br/>
    <br/>
    This is an open source project than can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/lnx00/TF2-Bot-List" target="_blank">here on GitHub</a>.
